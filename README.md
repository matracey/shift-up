# SHiFT-up

Redeeming SHiFT codes in-game is annoying, especially on consoles where you have to use the on-screen keyboard instead of a physical keyboard.

This command-line tool lets you redeem codes from the convenience of your computer, without having to launch a game.

## Prerequisites

- Node 10+
- NPM or Yarn
- A Gearbox SHiFT account (https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/)

## Instructions

1. install SHiFT-up

   ```bash
   bun install
   bun run build
   bun link
   ```

2. (first time only) enter your Gearbox SHiFT e-mail and password
   - `shiftup login <email> <password>`
   - your credentials are transmitted over a secure connection to Gearbox **only**
   - an authentication cookie will be stored inside `secrets/<email>.json`
     - this file contains your login session, do not share this file with anybody!
   - I will NEVER try to steal your credentials
3. Enter the code that you would like to redeem
   - `shiftup redeem <email> <code>`

If all went well, you should see the words "Your code was successfully redeemed".

## Known issues

Message:

> To continue to redeem SHiFT codes, please launch a SHiFT-enabled title first!

My best guess is that you reached some kind of hourly (daily?) limit. Come back later.

Message:

> 500 - ""

or

> StatusCodeError: 412 - "{}"

You probably entered a bad code.

## Planned features

- interactive mode: prompt for credentials and codes
- silent mode: don't log anything to stdout
- error handling (failed logins)
